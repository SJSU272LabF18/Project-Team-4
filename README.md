## 1.SJSU Safe Ride Tracking App
--------------------------------
#### **Abstract:**

In our SJSU campus, we have Safe Rides that is a shuttle service provided by university to drop
students and faculties within a specified parameter. To request for those rides we need to call
through Blue light phone or elevator phone.
Theses rides have specific pickup locations in campus which are mostly secluded and not that
safe. So, waiting for ride at that location for long time will not be a good option, rather we can
track the live location of those rides and plan to reach the pickup location accordingly. So, we are
proposing an idea to develop a web application,” SJSU Safe ride tracking app”.
This app will facilitate SJSU students and Faculties to track the live location of Safe Rides
operational in campus. We can also get shuttle driver’s contact number.

######  Technology stack needed:
1. UI: React-redux
2. DB: MongoDB
3. Backend: Node js
4. Cloud Hosting: AWS
5. Messaging: Kafka



## 2.Alexa App for Old people
-----------------------------

#### **Abstract:**

Alexa application as a pharmacy for old age people
Old people are not good at UI based applications, rather many online applications are not user
friendly for them. Voice based Alexa can help them in medical needs. It includes appointment,
prescription, refills, timing alerts, capturing timings of medicines.
Old people can place an order at a pharmacy for over the counter medicines. Doctors prescription
can be alerted via Alexa. They can also ask Alexa for refill, the date and time of medicine
consumption.

###### Technology Stack needed :
AWS lambda, NodeJs, ALexa SkillsAWS lambda, NodeJs, ALexa Skills

## 3. “Gun" detection and location tracking system
---------------------------------------------------

#### **Abstract:**

Mugging is a quotidian word in San Jose, especially in down town area. Moving around in San
Jose downtown is not safe all the times and could be dangerous because of the Gun Culture in
the States. Since SJSU is located in the downtown, students who have late evening classes or odd
timing classes might have a sense of fear for mugging, life threats etc. So, the idea is to design a
system which spies the location, detects the model of a “Gun” and alerts with the location, image
captured, details of the person who might be in trouble etc.
This Application facilitates in safer movement of people in San Jose, reducing risks.

###### Technology Stack needed :
MERN Stack, Object Detection model(Gun), Raspberry Pi(spy camera module), AWS or Heroku



## 4. Dustbin Capacity Notifier  - APPROVED
comment: it should also collect historical data and predict which one fills faster and suggest to replace with bigger one or more. Basically you are optimizing garbage collection and saving money while maintaining hygene. 
-------------------------------

#### **Abstract:**

There are large number of garbage bins in our university. The filling rate of each dustbin varies
i.e, some gets filled faster than others. This asks for attention because otherwise it can start to
stink which can cause negative effects on health / inconvenience to the people passing by.
So, Dustbin project suggests to have sensor attached to each dustbin which in turn will inform
the municipal management of the university whenever a dustbin needs any attention.

###### Technology Stack needed :
Raspberry PI, IR sensors, Server, Python, MongoDB
