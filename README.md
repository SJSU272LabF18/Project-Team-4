# Dustbin Capacity Notifier  - APPROVED
comment: it should also collect historical data and predict which one fills faster and suggest to replace with bigger one or more. Basically you are optimizing garbage collection and saving money while maintaining hygene. 
-------------------------------

#### **Abstract:**

There are large number of garbage bins in our university. The filling rate of each dustbin varies
i.e, some gets filled faster than others. This asks for attention because otherwise it can start to
stink which can cause negative effects on health / inconvenience to the people passing by.
So, Dustbin project suggests to have sensor attached to each dustbin which in turn will inform
the municipal management of the university whenever a dustbin needs any attention.

### ** Description **

Dustbin Capacity Notifier is used to notify the user regarding the capacity of the bins installed. This is a web application where the landing page will be a dashboard where user can see the list of bins. When user selects any of the bins, he can have a glance at these attributes of the bin :
•	Max Volume
•	Current Volume
•	Current Status
•	Expected Remaining Time to fill 
•	Bar graph for Capacity history of the bin for last 7 days
•	Bar graph for current filled height

###### Technology Stack needed :
Raspberry PI, IR sensors, Server, Python, MongoDB
